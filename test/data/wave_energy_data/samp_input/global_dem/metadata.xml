The seafloor data between latitudes 64° North and 72° South are from the work of Smith and Sandwell (1997). These data were derived from satellite altimetry observations combined with carefully, quality-assured shipboard echo-sounding measurements, by Dr. Walter H.F. Smith, of the NOAA Laboratory for Satellite Altimetry and Dr. David T. Sandwell, of the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics at the University of California, San Diego. Data version 8.2 is used here. 
For reference on generation of these data, consult: 
W.H.F. Smith and D.T. Sandwell, 1997, Global Sea Floor Topography from Satellite Altimetry and Ship Depth Soundings, Science 277 (5334), p.1956-1962. 
2.	Seafloor data southward of 72° South are from the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office's (NAVOCEANO) Digital Bathymetric Data Base Variable Resolution (DBDBV), version 4.1, gridded at 5 minute spacing; some data in this region are from the older DBDB5 (these data were also used in ETOPO5). Seafloor data northward from 64° North are from the new International Bathymetric Chart of the Arctic Ocean (IBCAO) Version 1. 
For reference on generation of the IBCAO data, consult: 
Jakobsson,M., N.Z. Cherkis, J. Woodward, R.Macnab, and B. Coakley. New grid of Arctic bathymetry aids scientists and mapmakers; Eos,Transactions, American Geophysical Union, v.81, no.9, p. 89,93,96.
3.	Land topography is from the GLOBE Project, an internationally designed, developed, and independently peer-reviewed global digital elevation model (DEM), at a latitude-longitude grid spacing of 30 arc-seconds (30"). The GLOBE Task Team was established by the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS). It is part of Focus I of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme - Data and Information System. Primary contributors to the GLOBE database are:
o	National Imagery and Mapping Agency (formerly Defense Mapping Agency), Fairfax, Virginia, USA 
o	Geographical Survey Institute, Tsukuba, Japan 
o	Australian Surveying and Land Information Group, Canberra, ACT, Australia 
o	Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, USA

The five major data sources were assembled into the single ETOPO2 2-minute data base without formal edge matching or other methods that alter the data as initially posted. Higher-resolution data take precedence: data derived from GLOBE mask all other data, Smith/Sandwell data come next, followed by IBCAO, with the 5-minute data filling any gaps. 

Five-minute data from DBDBV and ETOPO5 and 30-second data from GLOBE were regridded to 2 minute spacing by bicubic spline interpolation. IBCAO data were originally gridded in a polar stereographic projection; these data were interpolated along lines of constant latitude at 2 minute steps for every 2 minutes of latitude from 72° North to the pole.</procdesc></procstep><procstep><procdate>20040122</procdate><procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Downloaded each tile of the data from http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/relief/ETOPO2/, extracted each, and assembled all into a global data set.

1. The seafloor data between latitudes 64° North and 72° South are from the work of Smith and Sandwell (1997). These data were derived from satellite altimetry observations combined with carefully, quality-assured shipboard echo-sounding measurements, by Dr. Walter H.F. Smith, of the NOAA Laboratory for Satellite Altimetry and Dr. David T. Sandwell, of the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics at the University of California, San Diego. Data version 8.2 is used here. For reference on generation of these data, consult: W.H.F. Smith and D.T. Sandwell, 1997, Global Sea Floor Topography from Satellite Altimetry and Ship Depth Soundings, Science 277 (5334), p.1956-1962. 

2. Seafloor data southward of 72° South are from the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office's (NAVOCEANO) Digital Bathymetric Data Base Variable Resolution (DBDBV), version 4.1, gridded at 5 minute spacing; some data in this region are from the older DBDB5 (these data were also used in ETOPO5). Seafloor data northward from 64° North are from the new International Bathymetric Chart of the Arctic Ocean (IBCAO) Version 1. For reference on generation of the IBCAO data, consult: Jakobsson,M., N.Z. Cherkis, J. Woodward, R.Macnab, and B. Coakley. New grid of Arctic bathymetry aids scientists and mapmakers; Eos,Transactions, American Geophysical Union, v.81, no.9, p. 89,93,96. 

3. Land topography is from the GLOBE Project, an internationally designed, developed, and independently peer-reviewed global digital elevation model (DEM), at a latitude-longitude grid spacing of 30 arc-seconds (30"). The GLOBE Task Team was established by the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS). It is part of Focus I of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme - Data and Information System. Primary contributors to the GLOBE database are:

Data Base Assembly

The five major data sources were assembled into the single ETOPO2 2-minute data base without formal edge matching or other methods that alter the data as initially posted. Higher-resolution data take precedence: data derived from GLOBE mask all other data, Smith/Sandwell data come next, followed by IBCAO, with the 5-minute data filling any gaps. 

Five-minute data from DBDBV and ETOPO5 and 30-second data from GLOBE were regridded to 2 minute spacing by bicubic spline interpolation. IBCAO data were originally gridded in a polar stereographic projection; these data were interpolated along lines of constant latitude at 2 minute steps for every 2 minutes of latitude from 72° North to the pole.

The following steps were performed by ESRI: Downloaded each tile of the data from http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/relief/ETOPO2/, extracted each, and assembled all into a global data set. Insured that the coordinates are in decimal degrees.

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>d.mon</em> allows the user to start,
select, list, query the status of, release control of,
stop, and unlock control of, available graphics monitors.
The user can run this program either interactively (through
a series of menus), or non-interactively by typing the name
of the monitor to start, stop, select, or unlock, and any
desired flags on the command line.

<p>

<b>These parameters perform the following functions:</b> 

<ol>
<li><b>Start a Monitor.</b> 
<br>

In order to display on-screen GRASS graphics, the user must
<em>start</em> and <em>select</em> a graphics monitor.  By
default, the <em>start</em> command actually runs two
commands, to both start and select whatever monitor is
named by the user. (The user can get a list of available
monitors by setting the -l or -L flag on the command line.)
Note that some monitor drivers use environment 
<a href=variables.html>variables</a> or the specific
<a href=displaydrivers.html>driver documentation</a>.
<p>

When a monitor is <em>started</em>, it is therefore also
(automatically) <em>selected</em> for output, unless the

<em>-s</em> flag is set by the user; the user can also
explictly <em>select</em> a monitor that has been started
(see (3) below).  After a monitor is started, a blank
graphics frame should appear on whatever terminal the user
is using to display graphics.

<p>

The desired monitor should be started once and need not be restarted unless 
it is stopped (option <em>2</em>) for some reason. A monitor may continue 
to run for any length of time, even when no GRASS session is being run. 
The monitor program runs in the background. 

<li><b>Stop a Monitor.</b> 
<br>
Sometimes the monitor program needs to be stopped
(terminated).  Choosing option 2 will terminate a
user-specified monitor program.  A graphics monitor has two
different types of status:  monitor program <em>not
running</em>, and monitor <em>running</em>.  A monitor that
has been started and/or selected will be listed as running;
a monitor that has been stopped (or not started) will be
listed as not running.  The -L (list status) flag will list
the status of each monitor connected to the system.

<p>

<li><b>Select a Monitor.</b> 
<br>

When the user <em>starts</em> a monitor, it is also
(automatically) <em>selected</em> for graphics output
unless the user sets the <em>-s</em> flag.  In order to use
(direct graphics output to) a monitor, the user must
<em>select</em> that monitor for use, either by simply
starting the monitor without the -s flag or by explictly
selecting the monitor for output using option 3. Only
running monitors can be selected for graphics output.  Once
the user has <em>selected</em> a monitor for output, no
other user can use this monitor for graphics output until
the monitor driver is either <em>released</em> (by the
user) or <em>unlocked</em> (by any user on the system).


<p> 

The user can run multiple graphics monitors by simply
starting each of the graphics monitors drivers he wishes to
direct output to.  

<li><b>Release a Monitor.</b>
<br> Once a user has <em>selected</em> a monitor for
graphics output, it is locked for use by that user until
either: (1) the user voluntarily releases control of the
monitor for use by another (option 4), or (2) another GRASS
user <em>unlocks</em> the user's control of the monitor.
Menu option 4 appears only to the person who has selected
the monitor (since only that user can release control of
his selected graphics monitor.) If another user wishes to
<em>unlock</em> the user's control of the monitor, that
user must run <em>d.mon</em> from the command line and set
the <b>unlock=</b><em>name</em> parameter.


</ol>

You may choose multiple options within the <em>d.mon</em>
program.  

<h2>NOTES</h2>

The <em>d.mon</em> program can regulate control of graphics
monitors both in systems using multiple monitors and in
systems using a single graphics monitor. To increase the number
of monitors available to each user, the ASCII file
<em>$GISBASE/etc/monitorcap</em> needs to be modified.

"""This file contains functions to simulate overland flow on GIS rasters
    defined by DEM raster datasets.  Here are some conventions of this model:

    A single pixel defines its neighbors as follows:

    3 2 1
    4 p 0
    5 6 7

    The 'p' refers to 'pixel' since the flow model is pixel centric.

    One of the outputs from this model will be a flow graph represented as a
    sparse matrix.  The rows in the matrix are the originating nodes and the
    columns represent the outflow, thus G[i,j]'s value is the fraction of flow
    from node 'i' to node 'j'.  The following expresses how to calculate the
    matrix indexes from the pixels original row,column position in the raster.
    Given that the raster's dimension is 'n_rows' by 'n_columns', pixel located
    at row 'r' and colunn 'c' has index

        (r,c) -> r * n_columns + c = index

    Likewise given 'index' r and c can be derived as:

        (index) -> (index div n_columns, index mod n_columns) where 'div' is
            the integer division operator and 'mod' is the integer remainder
            operation."""

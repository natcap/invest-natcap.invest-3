    Input:
        args- A python dictionary created by the UI for use in the HRA model. It
            will contain the following data.
        args['workspace_dir']- String which points to the directory into which
            intermediate and output files should be placed.
        args['habitat_dir']- The string describing a directory location of all
            habitat shapefiles. These will be parsed though and rasterized to 
            be passed to hra_core module.
        args['stressors_dir']- The string describing a directory location of
            all stressor shapefiles. Will be parsed through and rasterized
            to be passed on to hra_core.'
        args['grid_size']- Int representing the desired pixel dimensions of
            both intermediate and ouput rasters. 
        args['ratings']- A structure which holds all exposure and consequence
            rating for each combination of habitat and stressor. The inner
            structure is a dictionary whose key is a tuple which points to a
            tuple of lists which contain tuples.

            {(Habitat A, Stressor 1): ([(E1Rating, E1DataQuality, E1Weight), ...],

                                       . }
    Output:
        hra_args- Dictionary containing everything that hra_core will need to
            complete the rest of the model run.

    Returns nothing.

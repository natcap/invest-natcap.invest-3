def execute(args):
    '''This function will prepare files passed from the UI to be sent on to the
    hra_core module.

    Input:
        args- A python dictionary created by the UI for use in the HRA model. It
            will contain the following data.
        args['workspace_dir']- String which points to the directory into which
            intermediate and output files should be placed.
        args['csv_uri']- The location of the directory containing the CSV files
            of habitat, stressor, and overlap ratings.         
        args['habitat_dir']- The string describing a directory location of all
            habitat shapefiles. These will be parsed though and rasterized to 
            be passed to hra_core module.
        args['stressors_dir']- The string describing a directory location of
            all stressor shapefiles. Will be parsed through and rasterized
            to be passed on to hra_core.'
        args['grid_size']- Int representing the desired pixel dimensions of
            both intermediate and ouput rasters. 
        args['risk_eq']- A string identifying the equation that should be used
            in calculating risk scores for each H-S overlap cell.
        args['decay_eq']- A string identifying the equation that should be used
            in calculating the decay of stressor buffer influence.
        args['max_rating']- An int representing the highest potential value that
            should be represented in rating, data quality, or weight in the
            CSV table.
        args['crit_uri']- The location of the shapefile criteria that we will
            use in our model. These will be rasterized and added to their
            approipriate dictionaries.

    Intermediate:
        hra_args['buffer_dict']- A dictionary that links the string name of each
            stressor shapefile to the desired buffering for that shape when
            rasterized.  This will get unpacked by the hra_preprocessor module.

            {'Stressor 1': 50,
             'Stressor 2': ...,
            }
    Output:
        hra_args- Dictionary containing everything that hra_core will need to
            complete the rest of the model run. It will contain the following.
        hra_args['workspace_dir']- Directory in which all data resides. Output
            and intermediate folders will be supfolders of this one.
        hra_args['h-s']- A multi-level structure which holds all criteria ratings, 
            both numerical and raster that apply to habitat and stressor 
            overlaps. The structure, whose keys are tuples of 
            (Habitat, Stressor) names and map to an inner dictionary will have
            3 outer keys containing numeric-only criteria, raster-based
            criteria, and a dataset that shows the potentially buffered overlap
            between the habitat and stressor. The overall structure will be as
            pictured:

            {(Habitat A, Stressor 1): 
                    {'Crit_Ratings': 
                        {'CritName': 
                            {'Rating': 2.0, 'DQ': 1.0, 'Weight': 1.0}
                        },
                    'Crit_Rasters': 
                        {'CritName':
                            {'DS': <CritName Raster>, 'Weight': 1.0, 'DQ': 1.0}
                        },
                    'DS':  <Open A-1 Raster Dataset>
                    }
            }
        args['habitats']- Similar to the h-s dictionary, a multi-level
            dictionary containing all habitat-specific criteria ratings and
            rasters. In this case, however, the outermost key is by habitat
            name, and habitats['habitatName']['DS'] points to the rasterized
            habitat shapefile provided by the user.
        args['stressors']- Similar to the h-s dictionary, a multi-level
            dictionary containing all stressor-specific criteria ratings and
            name, and stressors['stressorName']['DS'] points to the rasterized
            stressor shapefile provided by the user that will be buffered by
            the indicated amount in buffer_dict['stressorName'].
        hra_args['risk_eq']- String which identifies the equation to be used
            for calculating risk.  The core module should check for 
            possibilities, and send to a different function when deciding R 
            dependent on this.
        args['max_risk']- The highest possible risk value for any given pairing
            of habitat and stressor.
    Returns nothing.

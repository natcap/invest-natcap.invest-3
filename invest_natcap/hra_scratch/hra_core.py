    '''This provides the main calculation functionaility of the HRA model. This
    will call all parts necessary for calculation of final outputs.

    Inputs:
        args- Dictionary containing everything that hra_core will need to
            complete the rest of the model run. It will contain the following.
        args['workspace_dir']- Directory in which all data resides. Output
            and intermediate folders will be subfolders of this one.
        hra_args['h_s_c']- The same as intermediate/'h-s', but with the addition
            of a 3rd key 'DS' to the outer dictionary layer. This will map to
            a dataset URI that shows the potentially buffered overlap between the 
            habitat and stressor. Additionally, any raster criteria will
            be placed in their criteria name subdictionary. The overall 
            structure will be as pictured:

            {(Habitat A, Stressor 1): 
                    {'Crit_Ratings': 
                        {'CritName': 
                            {'Rating': 2.0, 'DQ': 1.0, 'Weight': 1.0}
                        },
                    'Crit_Rasters': 
                        {'CritName':
                            {'DS': "CritName Raster URI", 'Weight': 1.0, 'DQ': 1.0}
                        },
                    'DS':  "A-1 Dataset URI"
                    }
            }
        hra_args['habitats']- Similar to the h-s dictionary, a multi-level
            dictionary containing all habitat-specific criteria ratings and
            rasters. In this case, however, the outermost key is by habitat
            name, and habitats['habitatName']['DS'] points to the rasterized
            habitat shapefile URI provided by the user.
        hra_args['h_s_e']- Similar to the h_s_c dictionary, a multi-level
            dictionary containing habitat-stressor-specific criteria ratings and
            shapes. The same as intermediate/'h-s', but with the addition
            of a 3rd key 'DS' to the outer dictionary layer. This will map to
            a dataset URI that shows the potentially buffered overlap between the 
            habitat and stressor. Additionally, any raster criteria will
            be placed in their criteria name subdictionary. 
        args['risk_eq']- String which identifies the equation to be used
            for calculating risk.  The core module should check for 
            possibilities, and send to a different function when deciding R 
            dependent on this.
        args['max_risk']- The highest possible risk value for any given pairing
            of habitat and stressor.
        args['aoi_tables']- May or may not exist within this model run, but if it
            does, the user desires to have the average risk values by 
            stressor/habitat using E/C axes for each feature in the AOI layer
            specified by 'aoi_tables'. If the risk_eq is 'Euclidea', this will
            create risk plots, otherwise it will just create the standard HTML
            table for either 'Euclidean' or 'Multiplicative.'
        args['aoi_key']- The form of the word 'Name' that the aoi layer uses
            for this particular model run. 
    
    Outputs:
        --Intermediate--
            These should be the temp risk and criteria files needed for the 
            final output calcs.
        --Output--
            /output/maps/recov_potent_H[habitatname].tif- Raster layer depicting
                the recovery potential of each individual habitat. 
            /output/maps/cum_risk_H[habitatname]- Raster layer depicting the
                cumulative risk for all stressors in a cell for the given 
                habitat.
            /output/maps/ecosys_risk- Raster layer that depicts the sum of all 
                cumulative risk scores of all habitats for that cell.
            /output/maps/[habitatname]_HIGH_RISK- A raster-shaped shapefile
                containing only the "high risk" areas of each habitat, defined
                as being above a certain risk threshold. 

    Returns nothing.

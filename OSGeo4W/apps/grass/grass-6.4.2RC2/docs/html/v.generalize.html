<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.generalize</em>
is a module for the generalization of GRASS vector maps. This module
consists of algorithms for line simplification, line smoothing,
network generalization and displacement (new methods may be added later).
For more examples and nice pictures, see 
<em><a href="http://users.ox.ac.uk/~orie1848/tutorial.html">tutorial</a><br></em> 
<p>
If <em>type=area</em> is selected, boundaries of selected areas will be 
generalized, and the options <em>cats</em>, <em>where</em>, and 
<em>layer</em> will be used to select areas. 

<h2>NOTES</h2>
(Line) simplification is a process of reducing the complexity of vector 
features. The module transforms a line into another line consisting of 
fewer vertices, that still approximate the original line. Most of the 
algorithms described below select a subset of points on the original line.

<p>
(Line) smoothing is a "reverse" process which takes as input a line and 
produces a smoother approximate of the original. In some cases, this is 
achieved by inserting new vertices into the original line, and can total 
up to 4000% of the number of vertices in the original. In such an instance, 
it is always a good idea to simplify the line after smoothing.

<p>
Smoothing and simplification algorithms implemented in this module work 
line by line, i.e. simplification/smoothing of one line does not affect 
the other lines; they are treated separately.  Also, the first and the 
last point of each line is never translated and/or deleted. 

<h3>SIMPLIFICATION</h3>

<em>v.generalize</em> contains following line simplification algorithms:
<ul>
<li>Douglas-Peucker Algorithm</li>
<li>Douglas-Peucker Reduction Algorithm</li>
<li>Lang Algorithm</li>
<li>Vertex Reduction</li>
<li>Reumann-Witkam Algorithm</li>
<li>Remove Small Lines/Areas</li>
</ul>

Different algorithms require different parameters, but all the algorithms 
have one parameter in common: the <b>threshold</b> parameter. In general, 
the degree of simplification increases with the increasing value of 
<b>threshold</b>.<br>

<h4>ALGORITHM DESCRIPTIONS</h4>

<ul>
<li> <i>Douglas-Peucker</i> - "Quicksort" of line simplification, the 
     most widely used algorithm. Input parameters: <b>input</b>, 
     <b>threshold</b>. For more information, see: <br>
     <a href="http://geometryalgorithms.com/Archive/algorithm_0205/algorithm_0205.htm">http://geometryalgorithms.com/Archive/algorithm_0205/algorithm_0205.htm</a>.</li>
<li> <i>Douglas-Peucker Reduction Algorithm</i> is essentially the same 
     algorithm as the algorithm above, the difference being that it takes 
     an additional <b>reduction</b> parameter which denotes the percentage 
     of the number of points on the new line with respect to the number 
     of points on the original line. Input parameters: <b>input</b>, 
     <b>threshold</b>, <b>reduction</b>.</li>     
<li> <i>Lang</i> - Another standard algorithm. Input parameters: 
     <b>input</b>, <b>threshold</b>, <b>look_ahead</b>. 
     For an excellent description, see:  <br>
     <a href="http://www.sli.unimelb.edu.au/gisweb/LGmodule/LGLangVisualisation.htm">http://www.sli.unimelb.edu.au/gisweb/LGmodule/LGLangVisualisation.htm</a>.</li>
<li> <i>Vertex Reduction</i> - Simplest among the algorithms. Input 
     parameters: <b>input</b>, <b>threshold</b>.
     Given a line, this algorithm removes the points of this line which 
     are closer to each other than <b>threshold</b>. More precisely, if 
     p1 and p2 are two consecutive points, and the distance between p2 
     and p1 is less than <b>threshold</b>, it removes p2 and repeats the 
     same process on the remaining points.</li>
<li> <i>Reuman-Witkam</i> - Input parameters: <b>input</b>, 
     <b>threshold</b>. 
     This algorithm quite reasonably preserves the global characteristics 
     of the lines. For more information, see:  <br> 
     <a href="http://www.ifp.uni-stuttgart.de/lehre/vorlesungen/GIS1/Lernmodule/Lg/LG_de_6.html">http://www.ifp.uni-stuttgart.de/lehre/vorlesungen/GIS1/Lernmodule/Lg/LG_de_6.html</a> (german).</li>
</ul>

<i>Douglas-Peucker</i> and <i>Douglas-Peucker Reduction Algorithm</i> 
use the same method to simplify the lines. Note that 
<div class="code"><pre>
v.generalize input=boundary_county output=boundary_county_dp20 method=douglas threshold=20
</pre></div>
is equivalent to
<div class="code"><pre>
v.generalize input=boundary_county output=boundary_county_dp_red20_100 \
             method=douglas_reduction threshold=20 reduction=100
</pre></div>
However, in this case, the first method is faster. Also observe that
<i>douglas_reduction</i> never outputs more vertices than <i>douglas</i>,
and that, in general, <i>douglas</i> is more efficient than 
<i>douglas_reduction</i>. More importantly, the effect of
<div class="code"><pre>
v.generalize input=boundary_county output=boundary_county_dp_red0_30 \
             method=douglas_reduction threshold=0 reduction=30
</pre></div>
is that 'out' contains approximately only 30% of points of 'in'.

<h3>SMOOTHING</h3>

The following smoothing algorithms are implemented in <em>v.generalize</em>:

<ul>
<li><i>Boyle's Forward-Looking Algorithm</i> - The position of each point 
    depends on the position of the previous points and the point 
    <b>look_ahead</b> ahead. <b>look_ahead</b> consecutive points. Input 
    parameters: <b>input</b>, <b>look_ahead</b>.</li>
<li><i>McMaster's Sliding Averaging Algorithm</i> - Input Parameters: 
    <b>input</b>, <b>slide</b>, <b>look_ahead</b>.
    The new position of each point is the average of the <b>look_ahead</b> 
    points around. Parameter <b>slide</b> is used for linear interpolation 
    between old and new position (see below).</li>     
<li><i>McMaster's Distance-Weighting Algorithm</i> - Takes the weighted 
    average of <b>look_ahead</b> consecutive points where the weight is 
    the reciprocal of the distance from the point to the currently 
    smoothed point. The parameter <b>slide</b> is used for linear 
    interpolation between the original position of the point and newly 
    computed position where value 0 means the original position.
    Input parameters: <b>input</b>, <b>slide</b>, <b>look_ahead</b>.
    </li>
<li><i>Chaiken's Algorithm</i> - "Inscribes" a line touching the original 
    line such that the points on this new line are at least 
    <i>threshold</i> apart. Input parameters: <b>input</b>, 
    <b>threshold</b>. This algorithm approximates the given line very 
    well.</li>
<li> <i>Hermite Interpolation</i> - This algorithm takes the points of 
     the given line as the control points of hermite cubic spline and 
     approximates this spline by the points approximately 
     <b>threshold</b> apart. This method has excellent results for small 
     values of <b>threshold</b>, but in this case it produces a huge 
     number of new points and some simplification is usually needed. 
     Input parameters: <b>input</b>, <b>threshold</b>, <b>angle_thresh</b>.
     <b>Angle_thresh</b> is used for reducing the number of the points. 
     It denotes the minimal angle (in degrees) between two consecutive 
     segments of a line.</li>     
<li> <i>Snakes</i> is the method of minimisation of the "energy" of a 
     line. This method preserves the general characteristics of the lines 
     but smooths the "sharp corners" of a line. Input parameters 
     <b>input</b>, <b>alpha</b>, <b>beta</b>.
     This algorithm works very well for small values of <b>alpha</b> and 
     <b>beta</b> (between 0 and 5). These parameters affect the 
     "sharpness" and the curvature of the computed line.</li>                          
</ul>

One of the key advantages of <i>Hermite Interpolation</i> is the fact 
that the computed line always passes through the points of the original 
line, whereas the lines produced by the remaining algorithms never pass 
through these points. In some sense, this algorithm outputs a line which 
"circumscribes" the input line.

<p>
On the other hand, <i>Chaiken's Algorithm</i> outputs a line which 
"inscribes" a given line. The output line always touches/intersects the 
centre of the input line segment between two consecutive points. For 
more iterations, the property above does not hold, but the computed 
lines are very similar to the Bezier Splines. The disadvantage of the 
two algorithms given above is that they increase the number of points. 
However, <i>Hermite Interpolation</i> can be used as another 
simplification algorithm. To achieve this, it is necessary to set 
<i>angle_thresh</i> to higher values (15 or so). 

<p>
One restriction on both McMasters' Algorithms is that <i>look_ahead</i> 
parameter must be odd. Also note that these algorithms have no effect if 
<i>look_ahead = 1</i>. 

<p>
Note that <i>Boyle's</i>, <i>McMasters'</i> and <i>Snakes</i> algorithm 
are sometimes used in the signal processing to smooth the signals.
More importantly, these algorithms never change the number of points on 
the lines; they only translate the points, and do not insert any new points. 

<p>
<i>Snakes</i> Algorithm is (asymptotically) the slowest among the 
algorithms presented above. Also, it requires quite a lot of memory. 
This means that it is not very efficient for maps with the lines
consisting of many segments.

<h3>DISPLACEMENT</h3>

The displacement is used when the lines overlap and/or are close to each 
other at the current level of detail. In general, displacement methods 
move the conflicting features apart so that they do not interact and can 
be distinguished.   

<p>
This module implements an algorithm for displacement of linear features 
based on the <i>Snakes</i> approach. This method generally yields very 
good results; however, it requires a lot of memory and is not very efficient.

<p>
Displacement is selected by <b>method=displacement</b>. It uses the 
following parameters:

<ul>
<li>
<b>threshold</b> - specifies critical distance. Two features interact if 
they are closer than <b>threshold</b> apart.
</li>

<li>
<b>alpha</b>, <b>beta</b> - These parameters define the rigidity of lines. 
For larger values of <b>alpha</b>, <b>beta</b> (&gt;=1), the algorithm 
does a better job at retaining the original shape of the lines, possibly 
at the expense of displacement distance. If the values of <b>alpha</b>,
<b>beta</b> are too small (&lt;=0.001), then the lines are moved 
sufficiently, but the geometry and topology of lines can be destroyed. 
Most likely the best way to find the good values of <b>alpha</b>, <b>beta</b>
is by trial and error.
</li>

<li>
<b>iterations</b> - denotes the number of iterations the interactions 
between the lines are resolved. Good starting points for values of 
<b>iterations</b> are between 10 and 100.
</li>

</ul>

The lines affected by the algorithm can be specified by the <b>layer</b>,
<b>cats</b> and <b>where</b> parameters.

<!-- TODO: example(s) -->

<h3>NETWORK GENERALIZATION</h3>

Used for selecting "the most important" part of the network. This is based
on the graph algorithms. Network generalization is applied if method=network.
The algorithm calculates three centrality measures for each line in the
network and only the lines with the values greater than thresholds are selected.
The behaviour of algorithm can be altered by the following parameters:

<ul>
<li>
<b>degree_thresh</b> - algorithm selects only the lines which share a point
with at least <b>degree_thresh</b> different lines.
</li>
<li>
<b>closeness_thresh</b> - is always in the range (0, 1]. Only the lines 
with the closeness centrality value at least <b>closeness_thresh</b> apart 
are selected. The lines in the centre of a network have greater values of 
this measure than the lines near the border of a network. This means that 
this parameter can be used for selecting the centre(s) of a network. Note 
that if closeness_thresh=0 then everything is selected.
</li>
<li>
<b>betweeness_thresh</b> - Again, only the lines with a betweeness 
centrality measure at least <b>betweeness_thresh</b> are selected. This 
value is always positive and is larger for large networks. It denotes to 
what extent a line is in between the other lines in the network. This 
value is large for the lines which lie between other lines and lie on 
the paths between two parts of a network. In the terminology of road 
networks, these are highways, bypasses, main roads/streets, etc.
</li>
</ul>

All three parameters above can be presented at the same time. In that 
case, the algorithm selects only the lines which meet each criterion. 

<p>
Also, the outputed network may not be connected if the value of 
<b>betweeness_thresh</b> is too large.
